                                <p>At Shockwave Jujitsu, we grade all of our students in combat Jujitsu. We don't believe in doing boring Kata's &ndash; we
                                believe in one-on-one training, getting stuck in, and helping you figure what will really work. You want to learn a lot
                                of moves with your own shadow? Go learn ballet!</p>

                                <p>But what really separates us from the rest is that our instructors have backgrounds in Judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Kickboxing, MMA, and various other fighting styles. We incorporate these into our training to ensure you really get to learn from a variety of perspectives, and not just one narrow selection of techniques that might lose their edge in any given scenario.</p>

                                <p>As students progress to higher grades they will begin to learn a variety of defence techniques against assailants with different weapons, including clubs, knives and even guns. We also train in the use of the Kubotan, a perfectly legal  self-defence appliance you can carry with you on those lonely walks home that will give you a significant edge in any encounter.</p>

                                <p>Based on training twice each week students should be ready for their first belt in approximately 3 months, although this can vary depending on the students abilities and the effort put in. The time between each belt typically increases as you progress to higher belts.</p>

                                <p>Jujitsu "joo-jit-sue" (also known as <i>Jujutsu</i>, <i>Jiu-jitsu</i>) is an ancient Japanese martial art which is often described as the mother of all Japanese martial arts as many other systems originated from Jujitsu, e.g. the founder of Judo (Jigoro Kano) was a Jujitsu master who saw the potential for a sport in Jujitsu and came up with Kodokan Judo. Aikido also stemmed from an old Jujitsu school.</p>

                                <p>Although Jujitsu has older roots, it is most commonly associated with the methods of unarmed combat which the Samurai would use in feudal Japan when they were disarmed in battle. To someone with no experience of Jujitsu it is best described as an "all round" martial art as it has everything that a lot of other arts have and much more &ndash; punching, kicking, throws, locks and joint manipulation, chokes, grappling and ground work are all practiced in the art of Jujitsu.</p>

                            </dt>
                            <dd>
                                <p>There are few arts which are as good for practical self-defence as Jujitsu. Many arts will teach a lot of complicated strikes and high kicks which would be impossible to actually use if one was attacked on the street. In Jujitsu, students are taught defences against a wide variety of realistic situations &ndash; defence from rear attacks, holds, weapons, punches, kicks, attacks on the ground and many more. Another reason most people find it useful is the fact that size and strength is not a major factor and because of this Jujitsu is commonly taught in self defence courses to different people, in particular women.</p>
